AirSafePlus — Multi-Location IoT Air Quality Monitoring (Node-RED)

AirSafePlus is a production-style IoT monitoring system designed to simulate, analyze, and visualize air quality across multiple urban locations such as parks, construction zones, and traffic areas.

The system is built using Node-RED and follows a realistic end-to-end IoT pipeline:

Sensors → MQTT → Analytics → Dashboard → Alerts & Recommendations

This project demonstrates how smart-city air quality systems can deliver actionable insights instead of raw sensor data.

🎯 Project Motivation

Air quality monitoring is a critical smart-city challenge:
	•	Citizens need clear health-oriented insights, not just PM or CO₂ numbers
	•	City operators require real-time visibility and early warnings
	•	IoT systems must be transparent, explainable, and extensible

This project shows how to design an end-to-end IoT analytics solution that can later be connected to real sensors and cloud platforms.

🔧 Node-RED Flow Architecture

This overview shows the complete multi-location processing pipeline, including:
	•	Scenario generators
	•	Sensor simulation
	•	Spike prediction
	•	Risk engines
	•	MQTT publishing
	•	Dashboard outputs

	✅ Dashboard — Normal Environmental Conditions

Example of a low-risk scenario with stable PM2.5 and CO₂ levels.
The system reports normal exposure risk and recommends outdoor activities.

⚠️ Dashboard — High Risk & Alerts

Example of a high-risk situation caused by pollution spikes.
The system detects increased exposure risk, updates health indices, and generates actionable alerts.

📊 Dashboard — Metrics, Indices & Predictions

Detailed view of:
	•	PM2.5 & CO₂ time series
	•	Exposure risk level
	•	Sick-Day Index
	•	Air Safety Index
	•	Spike prediction indicators
